# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the Virtual Business Card Creator application.

To properly display screenshots in your README, you need to:

1. Take screenshots of your application
2. Save them with these filenames:
   - landing-page.png
   - features.png
   - card-creator.png
   - testimonials.png

3. Replace the placeholder files in this directory with your actual screenshots
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub

The screenshots should then display correctly in your README.md file.
